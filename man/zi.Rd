\usage{
dzi(x, Distr, p0, ...)

pzi(q, Distr, p0, ...)

qzi(p, Distr, p0, ...)

rzi(n, Distr, p0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, q}{Vector of quantiles.}

\item{Distr}{The name (as a function) of the continuous distribution model.}

\item{p0}{Probability of zero values (i.e., zero-inflation).}

\item{...}{Additional named arguments containing the continuous distribution parameters}

\item{p}{Vector of probabilities.}

\item{n}{Number of observations. If length(n) > 1, the length is taken to be the number required.}
}
\value{
dzi gives the density of the zero-inflated distribution model.
pzi gives the cdf of the zero-inflated distribution model.
qzi gives the quantile (ICDF) of the zero-inflated distribution model.
rzi gives random variates from the zero-inflated distribution model.
}
\description{
Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation
 for the zero-inflated (i.e., mixed) distribution model. This model is composed by two parts,
 1) the discrete part, which regards an atom at zero, and
 2) the continuous part, which regards a continuous distribution model (J-shaped and with left support >0).
}
\examples{
## Plot the CDF of a Gamma distribution.
p=seq(0,1,0.01)
x=qzi(p, Distr = qgamma, p0=0.7, shape=0.5, scale=1)
plot(x, p)

## Generate 100000 random variables with p0=0.7 and
## Gamma distribution for the continoous part.
X=rzi1000, qgamma, p0=0.7, shape=0.5, scale=1)
hist(X)

## Generate 100000 random variables with p0=0.7 and
## Burr type XII distribution for the continuous part.
## The actuar package is required, since it contains
## the d,p,q,r functions of the Burr type XII distribution.
require(actuar)
X=rzi(1000, qburr, p0=0.7, shape1=5, shape2=1, scale=1)
